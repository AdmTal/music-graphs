## Install

Alright, let's get you set up. This baby runs on Python, so let's prep your environment.

```commandline
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

You'll also need [ffmpeg](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ffmpeg).

```commandline
brew install ffmpeg
```

## Generate a Video

Ready to roll? Start with this example:

```commandline
python music_graphs.py --midi examples/wii-music.mid
```

This command churns out a video. But hold up, it's kinda vanilla, right? Let's jazz it up!

Run it with a Theme file:

```commandline
python music_graphs.py \
  --midi examples/wii-music.mid \
  --theme examples/wii-theme.yaml
```

Boom! Looks way cooler, doesn't it?

For all the nitty-gritty on customizing your video, peek at [default_theme.yaml](assets%2Fdefault_theme.yaml). There's a
bunch you can tweak!

See the help command for full options:

```commandline
Usage: music_graphs.py [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --midi PATH             Path to a MIDI file.  [required]
  --theme PATH            Path to a YAML theme file.
  --output_filename PATH  Output filename (path).
  --soundfont_file PATH   Path to a Soundfont file
  --help                  Show this message and exit.
```

## What's a "Sound Font" file?

For more details, check out [the wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoundFont), but the gist is: while a MIDI file
outlines the notes of a piece, a SoundFont file fills in the sound - it's what makes the notes come to life with actual
timbre and tone.
You can find better, more realistic sound fonts online.

For example - Look for "SGM-V2.01.sf2" on https://www.doomworld.com/forum/post/1827928.
